    "The metrics that were deemed more relevant to track were the following:\n",
    "- **Click-through rate for the homepage**. Selected as a measure of the initial ability of the category title to attract users.\n",
    "- **Drop-off rate for the category pages.** Percentage of users who leave the site from a given page, selected as a measure of the ability of the category page to meet user expectations.\n",
    "- **Homepage-return rate for the category pages**. percentage of users who navigated from the library homepage to the category page, then returned back to the homepage. This sequence of actions provides clues as to whether a user discovered the desired option on the category page; if not, the user would likely then return to the homepage to continue navigation. Homepage-return rate was therefore selected as a measure of the ability of the category page to meet user expectations.\n",

    "It was decided that for a version to be considered superior, a min increase in click-through rate of 40% had to be detected.\n",
    "When the variations from the original website are very stark, a conservative approach is to the test variables in this case study were largely non-disruptive, 100% of website visitors were included\n",

    "Currently, the CTR for Interact sits at around 2%, and the page has around 1650 visitors every day. The desired Statistical Significance was 90%. With these numbers, a power calculator like this one can be used to decide on the length of the test. The length of the experiment was established at 21 days:\n",
